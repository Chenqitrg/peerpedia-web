"""Specification: Database Session Lifecycle

The `db_session_scope` context manager provides a safe, predictable lifecycle
for every database session. Every caller — CRUD, workflow, route handler —
must be able to rely on the same contract without repeating boilerplate.

Contract:
  S1 — On successful exit, the session commits.
  S2 — On exception, the session rolls back and the exception propagates.
  S3 — In both cases, the session is closed in the finally block.
  S4 — The yielded session is usable for standard ORM operations.
  S5 — Nested begin/commit within the context work as expected (sub-transactions).
