## Design Issues Index

Every chapter ends with an "Issues" section. Here's the full list:

| # | Issue | Chapter | Severity |
|---|-------|---------|----------|
| I1 | JWT in localStorage — XSS risk if user HTML rendering added | 02 | Medium |
| I2 | `restoreSession` race condition — flash of unauthenticated content | 02 | Low |
| I3 | `pendingCreds` infinite retry on permanent failure | 02 | Medium |
| I4 | `connectionState` lost on app restart — reset to idle | 02 | Low |
| I5 | EditorPage is ~700 lines — needs composable extraction | 03 | Medium |
| I6 | `useAsyncResource` re-fetches on every mount — no SWR | 03 | Low |
| I7 | Conflict resolution requires full page refresh — stale on failure | 03 | Low |
| I8 | SQLite in production — write serialization bottleneck | 04 | High |
| I9 | No rate limiting — /health and auth unprotected | 04 | High |
| I10 | JWT secret hardcoded in source | 04 | Critical |
| I11 | Git repos grow unbounded — no GC, no pruning | 04 | Low |
| I12 | Typst sidecar blocks UI thread — synchronous IPC | 05 | Medium |
| I13 | No CSP in Tauri config — XSS vector | 05 | High |
| I14 | SQLite connection not pooled — writes block reads | 05 | Low |
| I15 | No backup/export for ~/.peerpedia/ local data | 05 | Medium |
| I16 | No Markdown→PDF on desktop — server-only path | 06 | Medium |
| I17 | Typst compilation blocks UI — no progress bar | 06 | Medium |
| I18 | Compilation cache never expires — unbounded growth | 06 | Low |
| I19 | Math protection is regex-based — edge case dollar signs | 06 | Medium |
| T1 | Phone model vs auto-detect — unresolved design tension | 01 | High |
| T2 | `connecting` invisible to useOffline — no loading state | 01 | Medium |
| T3 | `isOnline` backward compat masks design intent | 01 | Medium |
| T4 | Two sync systems with confusing naming overlap | 01 | High |
| G1 | No SyncButton integration test with real state machine | 07 | Medium |
| G2 | No client.ts interceptor tests | 07 | Medium |
| G3 | No useArticleSync + useNetworkStatus integration test | 07 | Medium |
| TD1-6 | Various technical debt items | 07 | — |

## How to Use This

**For ChatGPT/Claude review:** Paste chapters 00-07 in order. Ask: "Find contradictions, design flaws, and things that will break in production."

**For onboarding:** Read 00 first, then jump to whichever chapter covers your task.

**For design review:** Focus on chapters 01 (network) and 02 (state) — these have the most unresolved tensions.

**For security review:** Search "Issue" across all chapters. I10 (JWT secret) and I13 (CSP) are the highest priority.
